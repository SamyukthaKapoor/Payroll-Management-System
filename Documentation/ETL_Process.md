# ETL Process Documentation

This document details the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes implemented using Talend Open Studio for our Payroll Management System Data Warehouse.

## ETL Architecture

Our ETL architecture follows a dimensional modeling approach with a focus on incremental loading and data quality. The ETL process is organized into the following components:

1. Dimension table loads (run first)
2. Fact table loads (run after dimensions)
3. Control flow orchestration

## Dimension Table ETL Processes

As shown in the project documentation, we implemented insert/update flows for all dimension tables:

### Employee Dimension

The Employee dimension ETL process:
- Extracts employee data from the source_payroll_management source
- Performs lookups to check for existing records
- Applies transformations including standardizing name formats
- Loads data using a type-2 slowly changing dimension approach

### Department Dimension

The Department dimension ETL process:
- Extracts department data from source systems
- Maps department codes to descriptive names
- Adds metadata including employee counts per department
- Loads using insert/update strategy

### Designation Dimension

The Designation dimension ETL process:
- Extracts job title and role information
- Standardizes designation nomenclature
- Enriches with hierarchy information
- Loads using insert/update logic

### Branch Dimension

The Branch dimension ETL process:
- Extracts branch location data
- Adds geographical hierarchy connections
- Links to State/City dimensions
- Implements standard insert/update methodology

### Date Dimension

The Date dimension ETL process:
- Generates date records programmatically
- Creates calculated calendar attributes (day of week, month, quarter, etc.)
- Loads pre-calculated data for reporting efficiency

### Deductions Dimension

The Deductions dimension ETL process:
- Extracts deduction categories and rates
- Normalizes deduction types
- Implements insert/update with historical tracking

### Overtime Dimension

The Overtime dimension ETL process:
- Extracts overtime data including hours and rates
- Calculates overtime compensation
- Implements insert/update flow

### State and City Dimension

The State/City dimension ETL process:
- Extracts location hierarchies
- Establishes parent-child relationships
- Loads using insert/update logic

## Fact Table ETL Process

### Payroll Fact Table

The Payroll fact table ETL process:
- Extracts core transaction data
- Performs lookups to all dimension tables to retrieve surrogate keys
- Calculates measures including:
  - Average Base Pay
  - Average Deductions
  - Overtime Cost (overtime_hours * overtime_rate)
  - Net Pay (base_pay + overtime_cost - deduction_amount)
- Loads using incremental strategy to minimize processing time

## Control Flow

The control flow orchestrates the entire ETL process, ensuring proper sequence and dependency management:

1. First loads dimension tables in parallel where possible
2. Then loads the fact table once dimensions are complete
3. Implements error handling and logging

## Transformations Implemented

As documented in our project, we implemented several key transformations:

1. **Sequential to Primary Key Transformation**: Transformed sequential values from SEQ to a SERIAL PRIMARY KEY for all dimension tables. This approach establishes unique identifiers for each record, ensuring data integrity and supporting optimized indexing.

2. **Date Format Standardization**: Standardized all date fields to the YYYY-MM-DD format to maintain consistency across tables, enhancing readability and simplifying date-related queries.

3. **Data Type Conversion**: Converted and standardized data types during the ETL process to ensure compatibility with the target schema, which helped prevent data inconsistency and streamlined query processing.

## Data Quality Measures

Our ETL processes include several data quality checks:

1. Rejection of records with missing key fields
2. Validation of referential integrity
3. Standardization of formats and data types
4. Error logging and notification

## Incremental Loading Strategy

To optimize processing time, we implemented:

1. Change data capture for source systems
2. Incremental loading based on modified timestamps
3. Lookup components to identify new or changed records

## Scheduling

The ETL jobs are designed to be run:

1. Dimension loads: Daily at off-peak hours
2. Fact table loads: Daily after dimension loads complete
3. Full refresh: Monthly for data quality validation
